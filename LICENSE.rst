[PackageName] is licensed under the MIT_ license. This is the shortest and probably broadest of all the popular open-source licenses. Its terms are very loose and more permissive than most other licenses. It is also compatible with GPL_.

The license can be found in the LICENSE_ file that is located in the root folder of the repository::

The license is explained in `a short guide to open source licenses <http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/24/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/>`_:

- You can use, copy and modify the software however you want. No one can prevent you from using it on any project, from copying it however many times you want and in whatever format you like, or from changing it however you want.
- You can give the software away for free or sell it. You have no restrictions on how to distribute it.
- The only restriction is that it be accompanied by the license agreement.

The MIT License is the least restrictive license out there. It basically says that anyone can do whatever they want with the licensed material, as long as it is accompanied by the license.
